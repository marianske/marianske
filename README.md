## Hi there, I'm Marianne Sievers👋

I love finding out things - the most if they seem important to know - not only to me but to the world. 

And that's why I was a freelance journalist at some point in my life - while having different main jobs which all had a focus on communications and social media.
Now, I transitioned to Data Analytics, to add a more analytical and technical approach to my research passion. With this, I'm kinda circling back to my B.A. in Sociology where statistics was quiet a big part.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on extending my network in the tech field, extending my Data Analysis skills, meeting frequently with my great mentor from #[Correlaid]([url](https://www.correlaid.org/)) (Data4Good projects!)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the skills I touched on in the Bootcamp which I did with wonderful Le Wagon: SQL (BigQuery), DBT, Python, Google Sheets, Looker Studio, Power BI.
-  👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects, also as a volunteer - as long as it seems relevant for me.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding junior, intern or volunteer positions.
- 💬 Ask me about hiking.
